Vulkan Projects
===============
Small projects to learn the Vulkan API and explore 3D graphics.


Setup
=====
Projects build against the Vulkan SDK, GLM, and GLFW. A shader compiler is also
required to compile GLSL to bytecode. Setup for Arch:
```
sudo pacman -S vulkan-devel glfw-x11 glm shaderc
```
